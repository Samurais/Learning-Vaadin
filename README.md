# Learning-Vaadin
[Learning Vaadin 7](http://www.packtpub.com/learning-vaadin-7-second-edition/book) is a book entrenched in reality, aimed at learning the Vaadin framework in a practical way, step-by-step.

This Github repository contains the source code contained in the book.

## Twaattin
The book goes through all steps of learning Vaadin concepts, by building [Twaattin](../twaattin), a Twitter client made with the [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) framework.

## Other examples
### Chapter 7
Chapter 7 introduces advanced features.

* **[Server Push](../../../server-push)**: this project displays the time in the browser, and the server updates it regularly.

### Chapter 8
Chapter 8 is about add-ons, librarires that enhance Vaadin. Some are server-side, some are client-side.

* **[Button group](../../../buttongroup)**: this project illustrates integrating an add-on with client-side code, and more specifically how to compile GWT code.
* **[Clara](../../../clara)**: this project displays uses of [Clara](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/clara), an add-on that make it possible to describe UI declaratively with XML instead of programmatically with Java.
* **[JPA Container](../../../jpacontainer)**: this project shows how to use the [JPAContainer add-on](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/vaadin-jpacontainer), letting us bind a table component to a database table through a JPA model.
* **[CDI Utils](../../../cdiutils)**: this project is a lightweigh Twaattin rewrite using the power of the [CDI Utils add-on](directory#addon/cdi-utils).
